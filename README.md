## 📱 Mobile Integration (React Native)

This backend is prepared for seamless integration with React Native. Key tips:

### 1. Handling Authentication
Tokens are returned in the `Authorization` header during login.
```javascript
// Example: Storing token in React Native
const token = response.headers.get('Authorization');
await AsyncStorage.setItem('userToken', token);
```

### 2. Request Headers
Include the JWT in every protected request:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('YOUR_API_URL/api/v1/users/me', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': await AsyncStorage.getItem('userToken'),
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

### 3. Image Loading
ActiveStorage URLs are provided in the responses. Use them directly in `<Image />` tags. For variants (thumbnails), you can request specific sizes via the backend API.
